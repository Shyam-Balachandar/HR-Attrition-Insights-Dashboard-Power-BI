 HR Attrition Insights Dashboard – Power BI

## 🎯 Why This Project?

Employee attrition is a major cost driver for organizations, especially in departments like Sales, HR and R&D. Business and HR leaders need data-driven tools to:

- Identify high-risk employee groups
- Understand what factors drive attrition (income, overtime, satisfaction)
- Take proactive actions to improve retention

This project was built to simulate a real-world HR request:  
**"Help us understand why people are leaving and what we can do about it."**
